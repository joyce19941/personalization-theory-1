Recommendation system with Yelp review dataset

This project focused on developing two specific recommendation algorithms, one is item-based collaborative filtering, which utilizes item similarity to make predictions based on available ratings, the other is model-based collaborative filtering, a matrix factorization algorithm is used to derive latent features that associate with users and items.  By performing cross-validation on the models, this report seeks to obtain data that supposedly may clarify ambiguities regarding the accuracy of different algorithms. All of the model comparisons and evaluations are done with the RMSE metric.

This project was written in Python. The repository contains following files:
